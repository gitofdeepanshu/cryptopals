# Cryptopals Challenges in Rust

This repository contains solutions to the [Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com) implemented in Rust programming language. The challenges cover a range of cryptography topics and aim to strengthen your understanding of the subject.
I personally think it is a good way to increase your understaning of RUST programming language

WARNING: This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Contents
- [Challenge 1: Basic Crypto](#challenge-1-basic-crypto)
  - Contains 8 challenges that focus on basic cryptography concepts such as single-byte XOR cipher, fixed XOR, and hexadecimal decoding.
- [Challenge 2: Block Crypto](#challenge-2-block-crypto)
  - Contains 8 challenges that deal with cryptography at the block level, including fixed-nonce CBC encryption, detection of ECB mode, and more.
- [Challenge 3: Block & Stream Crypto](#challenge-3-block-and-stream-crypto)
  - Contains 8 challenges that combine both block and stream cryptography, such as CTR encryption mode, password reset tokens, and more.
- [Challenge 4: Stream Crypto and Randomness](#challenge-4-stream-crypto-and-randomness)
  - Contains 8 challenges that focus on stream cryptography and random number generation, including breaking random access read/write AES CTR and more.
- [Challenge 5: Diffie-Hellman and Friends](#challenge-5-diffie-hellman-and-friends)
  - Contains 8 challenges that explore Diffie-Hellman and its variants, including breaking and fixing DH with parameters of your own choice, and more.
